# AWS-EKS Activities

### These activities are a continuation of the in-class activites offered in CS39AB (Cloud Computing) By Thyago Mota at MSU Denver. In these activiies, we explore how distributed systems for AWS using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The first activity sets up a developer environment locally from which they can communicate with and manage remote EKS clusters. The second activity explores how to connect local and cloud-based nodes in the same cluster.
